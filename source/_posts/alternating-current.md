## alternating current

 **an alternating emf** which continuously changes its magnitude and whose direction is changed many times per second

## Direct current

###  Manifestations of Electric Current
**electric current** is the process of motion of charges in a body when a potential difference is created between its parts. charge carriers are either ions (positively or negatively charged molecules or atoms) or free electrons. 

 **direct or constant current**: The positive electrode always remains positive and the negative electrode remains negative: the current in the external circuit flows in the same direction, viz. from the positive electrode to the negative one. 

When the circuits are closed, the following phenomena will be observed.电流的各种效应：

-  thermal effect （glowing of the bulb）

-  magnetic effect

-  chemical effect

  **category of conductors**： first-kind conductors: carbon and metals. the second-kind conductors is electrolytes（电解质）,which are decomposed by an electric current into components。
  
  **Volta's rule**: in a circuit consisting of an arbitrary number of different metals (first-kind conductors), the  (voltage) is equal to zero.
   **galvanic cells（原电池）**: an electric cell that generates an electromotive force by an irreversible conversion of chemical to electrical energy ;cannot be rechargeed .
  
  **Wimshurt machines（静电发电机）**：

## Chemical and Thermal Generators
**Voltanic cell**: Two different metals (copper and zinc) of the circuit are in contact with an electrolyte (sulphuric acid solution). 

### Accumulators (充电)

Accumulators：constructed a cell with two lead electrodes immersed in sulphuric acid solution. a current is passed through this cell for a certain time, the products of electrolysis are deposited on its electrodes（电极） and enter into chemical reactions with the electrodes. In this state, the cell itself is a current source which, when connected to a circuit, can create a temporary current in it. （the emf（electricmotive force/voltage ） of polarisation （极化））
### Thermocouples （热电偶）
Volta's rule is true only if all the junctions (the regions of contact between conductors) are at the same temperature .
**thermoelectromotive force (thermo-emf) （热电动力，温差电动势）**:in a circuit composed of different metals while junctions are at different temperatures, a certain emf operates.

## Electromagnetic Induction

We want to know **Conditions for Emergence of Induced Current**,here is the formula:
